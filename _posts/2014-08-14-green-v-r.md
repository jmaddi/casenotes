**Issue:**

Whether particular sensitivities of accused should be relevant to defence of provocation.

**Facts:**

Accused was sleeping at house of deceased. After going to bed, the deceased entered the accused's bed and started to touch him sexually. The accused protested, then started punching the deceased. He then found a pair of scissors on the floor and used them to stab the deceased repeatedly.

The accused contends that he lost control because the experience reminded him of his father sexually abusing his sisters. The trial court contended that this evidence is irrelevant to an assessment of the provocation defence.

**Ratio:**

Extent of provocation must be assessed in relation to the accused
> In determining the gravity of the provocation to the accused it is relevant to take into account the accused's own circumstances.

Response to provocation must be assessed in relation to a hypothetical 'ordinary person' experiencing provocation of the above extent
> the phrase "an ordinary person in the position of the accused" means an ordinary person who suffered the provocation which the accused suffered as the result of the conduct of the deceased.
